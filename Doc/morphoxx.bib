  abstract = {The MorphoxX Project studies various kinds of morphing methods based
	on cages. Cages are a simple way to deform and animate objects. Basically,
	objects are surrounded by cages, the cages are deformed by artists,
	and the deformed objects are computed.
	
	
	To deform objects via cages, one should introduce a coordinate system.
	Several choices are available, and this project aims to implement
	and compare Mean Value Coordinates, Harmonic Coordinates, and Green
	Coordinates.
	
	
	Finally, my source code is available (for free!) on the project Google
	Code website.},
